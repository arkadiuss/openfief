Given a viewer asking the Ask box, when the call is entered, then the actor is a viewer with the session's ID, never the owner; and when the session has ended or the person was revoked, the log still names them.

## Context

D-211: every change of state is an entry of the audit log, failing closed. Asked for in the S9 brief.

## Source

> An append-only audit log records every change of state and every access event: sign-ins and sign-outs, passkeys, enrollment links, script tokens, grants, settings, the owner's entries and corrections, decisions on attention items, plugin installs and upgrades the operator applies, and model and MCP calls. Each entry names who, what, which records by ID, when and the outcome, never an amount, a secret or a question's text (GR-12). Settings shows it to the owner, filterable.
